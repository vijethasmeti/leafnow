    <h1>Leaf Now</h1>
    
<p>
    When you plant a tree, you don’t just plant a sapling but hope. We have learned it the hard way that trees are extremely important for our survival. We first resorted to deforestation and made space for more buildings on earth. 
     </p>
     <p>
        Later, when we saw the environment getting seriously affected, we were introduced to something called “afforestation”, a simple process of planting more trees for a better future.

Trees are essentially the livestock of humankind and other living organisms. 
</p>
<h2>Importance of planting.</h2>
<p>   We have our global Tree Plantation Day which is celebrated on 21st March all over the world. The aim behind observing the said day is to make people aware of the importance of planting trees and help them realize the same. A common practice during tree plantation day is to plant saplings in order to invest in the future. </p>
<p>
    But why only plant trees when the day says so, every day is tree plantation day and we must work towards building a secure future for other generations to come. We should not be restricted by the standard norms of society and rise above ourselves and our nature before our selfish needs. If you don’t save trees, in return your atmosphere will have less oxygen and the primary source of livestock and food will be eliminated from the earth. </p>
<p>
    Since the very beginning trees have given us the gift of life's essentials, such as food and oxygen. Many generations passed and we discovered other many uses of trees and exploited them for our survival. They are so rich in value and significance that their uses have only increased as to satisfy the needs created by our modern lifestyles.
</p>
<p>
    To begin with, the wood from the trees was used as fuel and the fruits were consumed by humans. The shade was used to escape heat and fire to escape in cold. 

As we evolved and started having modern problems, trees yet remained the same but cater to our modern problems as well. 
</p>
<p>
    Trees can cut down on energy and conserve a lot of electricity if planted in the right place and they provide you with the richest oxygen available in the atmosphere. However, we overlook these benefits and take trees for granted. 
</p>
<p>
    We cut the very trees that give us so much to live with and then mull over the fact that nature is being unfair. Well, we need to respect Mother Nature and value the great advantages that trees bless us with every day. 

</p>
<p>We at Leaf Now provide plants and seeds to people who wants to contribute in making earth a better place to live in with greenary all around the world.
    We provide samplings and seeds to users who wants plant.We also buy samplings and seed from the users who are unable to plant them. </p>
